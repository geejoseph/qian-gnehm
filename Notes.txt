NOTES
8 cores, x2 hyperthreading so 16 threads
What is good ratio of number of tasks vs. threads? x4? x10?
Total time used by threads with clock? *real work*
How to get good times for graphing iterations, diff images, diff steps
Does any one of the 4 sweeps take most of the time? Rows vs. cols?
Memory access patterns? Do more rows? Big diff?
Possible to do two finds in parallel

TODO
1. Second version of sequential and timing
2. Rows and cols
3. More fine-grained, thread for each part of row or col that owns regions
4. Scheduling?
