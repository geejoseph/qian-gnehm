NOTES
8 cores, x2 hyperthreading so 16 threads
What is good ratio of number of tasks vs. threads? x4? x10?
Total time used by threads with clock? *real work*
How to get good times for graphing iterations, diff images, diff steps
Does any one of the 4 sweeps take most of the time? Rows vs. cols?
Memory access patterns? Do more rows? Big diff?
Graph n_threads and speedup?

TODO
1. More fine-grained, thread for each part of row or col that owns regions
2. Try scheduling again?

To get side-by-side image:
./seq-solution img/Lakeside.jpg seq-result
./par-solution img/Lakeside.jpg par-result
convert par-result.ppm seq-result.ppm -append compare.ppm

To get difference:
compare -compose src par-result.ppm seq-result.ppm difference.ppm
