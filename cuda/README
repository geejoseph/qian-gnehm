Note that this directory is designated for the cuda solution and its accompanying sequential version.

To test simply run make and then ./solution

To change test images simply edit the image path string within the main file. 

You can alternate between the two versions by calling either seq_process or cu_process

Finally, to test the different cuda attempts, within cu_process in cu-solution.cu,
simply change between attempt_{1,2,3} (1 is naive, 2 is shared mem, 3 is hybrid)
