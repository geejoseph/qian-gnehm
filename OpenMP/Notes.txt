NOTES
8 cores, x2 hyperthreading so 16 threads
How to get good times for graphing iterations, diff images, diff steps
Does any one of the 4 sweeps take most of the time? Rows vs. cols?
Memory access patterns? Do more rows? Big diff?
Had 16 GB or RAM, Intel Core i7 CPU for thread version,
We also had Intel Core i7 CPU but eight of them for our parallel implementation. Not sure if they used multiple cores, although they still had hyperthreading (so at least 2 threads?)\\

TODO
1. More fine-grained, thread for each part of row or col that owns regions
2. Try scheduling again?

To get side-by-side image:
./seq-solution img/Lakeside.jpg seq-result
./par-solution img/Lakeside.jpg par-result
convert par-result.ppm seq-result.ppm -append compare.ppm

To get difference:
compare -compose src par-result.ppm seq-result.ppm difference.ppm
